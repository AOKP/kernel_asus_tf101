	  Say Y here to get to see options for device drivers for various
	  compasses. This option alone does not add any kernel code.

	  This enables support for the Aichi Steel ami304/ami305 compass
	  This support is for integration with the MPU3050 or MPU6050 gyroscope
	  device driver.  Only one compass can be registered at a time.
	  Specifying more that one compass in the board file will result
	  in runtime errors.
